<h1>About</h1>

This is a simple program that I made for making it easy to make choices.
I felt the need for this when I had to make a difficult choice in a visual novel I was reading.

Features:
	This program has a Japanese translation.
	This program can be used for randomizing any number of choices.
	This program can be used with any kind of choices, numbers, words, names, special characters etc.
	This program handles any incorrect inputs and provides correct format for input.		
	The code is written in a way that is self explanatory and therefore no comments are needed.
	This program is free for anyone to use, modify and distribute.

 Planned Features:
	Add an option to select the number of times the list is randomized before result is outputted.
	Display percentage for the wins of each result.
